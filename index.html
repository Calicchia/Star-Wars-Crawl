        <h1>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel
        spaceships, striking from a hidden
        base, have won their first victory
        against the evil Galactic Empire.
        During the battle, Rebel spies managed
        to steal secret plans to the Empire's
        ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an
        armored space station with enough
        power to destroy an entire planet.
        Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
        Princess Leia races home aboard her
        starship, custodian of the stolen plans
        that can save her people and restore
        freedom to the galaxy....
        you know, it looks like a poem, but it sure as hell don't read like a poem. George Lucas needs to work on his meter, I think.</p>
